Visual Argument Project:

My current project is a visual argument showing the effects of global warming on the world. Currently, I've only used three image sources (all included in the repo) to make this version of the project, and used layer transparencies, color and contrast adjustment settings, auto selection, the eraser, cropping and layer merging to make what I have now. This repo includes the .psd file (I used Photoshop so far to make my visual argument), my image sources and the image itself.
